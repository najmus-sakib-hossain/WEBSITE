Awesome now! Please rename all the crates to not have the dx prefix. Also I already created dx serializer crate, which is 14% more token efficient than toon, so we will use dx serializer instead of toon. And we also have all the 50+ tools so you don't have to give me tools or CLI or TY related code as we are currently only focusing on creating crates related to saving tokens!!!
